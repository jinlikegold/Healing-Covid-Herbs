                    <p>Three years into a global pandemic in which millions have died and countless more have suffered, there is yet no standard, comprehensive treatment protocol capable of addressing the pernicious effects of Covid-19, particularly in chronic cases of "long Covid." 
                        When my immunocompromised partner tested positive, I (the <a href="http://jincodes.com">site creator</a>) came across Stephen Buhner's extensive recommendations for a herbal treatment protocol. We were deeply familiar with his work on Lyme Disease, having used it to support ourselves and family members with remarkable results,
                        and I have found his Covid research to be nearly as extensive, despite being created in an astonishingly short amount of time given the rapid pandemic onset.   </p>
                    <p>Since Buhner did not have the opportunity to develop this information into a book or more accessible format, I decided to use the skills at my disposal to create a site to house his core treatment recommendations for easy reference and sharing. </p>

                <div class="px-3">
                    <p>Buhner was an illustrious herbalist and author who, in his own words, "Developed the first comprehensive text on herbal antivirals in American herbalism" and "Developed the most complex understanding (at the present time) of the sophistication and synergy of herbal medicines in the treatment of chronic diseases and their capacity for subtle modulation of human physiology during such disease conditions."</p> 
                    <p>His work on antivirals and Lyme Disease, among many other pieces of scientific writing and research, was and continues to be groundbreaking. Thanks to his dedication to service and sharing his knowledge, Bunher's work has helped countless individuals heal and recover from complex conditions little understood by the modern Western medical industry.</p>
